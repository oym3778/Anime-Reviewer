# 🎌 Anime Review Hub

A personal **anime review and comparison platform** — currently in development.

**Anime Review Hub** is a React-based project where users can search for anime, add them to a personal watch list, and write reviews to capture how each show made them feel.  
The goal is to create a fun, personalized space for tracking your anime journey and discovering new shows through friends and shared preferences.

This project is actively being built as part of my portfolio, with new features added weekly.
